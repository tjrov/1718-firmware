/*Modbus Register contents (add more as needed, these are the bare minimum to control robot functions
The library requires an array of UNsigned 16-bit integers, but we can use them as needed
The purpose of each element of the array is listed by index here:
//=============Fast loop data (High priority) =================
0. Thruster Speed #1 (signed 16-bit integers. Negative is reverse, positive is forward)
1. Thruster Speed #2 (Can be sent directly to ESCs over i2c bus)
2. Thruster Speed #3
3. Thruster Speed #4
4. Thruster Speed #5
5. Thruster Speed #6
6. Manipulator Speeds #1, #2 (8-bit signed integer. High byte controls one motor, 
                              low byte controls other motor)
7. Manipulator Speeds #3, #4 (Negative is reverse, positive is forward, abs value is speed
                             see pindefs.h for guidelines controlling manipulators)
8. Voltage @ ROV (see pindefs.h for analog pin to use)
9. Yaw (these are floating points ranging -180 <-> 180 degrees. We don't need more than one decimal
        place precision)
10. Pitch
11. Roll
12. Depth Reading (Use conversion methods in sensor library to get mbars and send that up for conversion to depth based on weather conditions)
//==============Slow loop data (Low priority; you don't have to check these unless you want to)================
13. Booleans for the two relay control pins' states, headlights state, buzzer (for OBS activation) state (use each bit as a boolean)
14. Thruster RPM #1
15.Thruster RPM #2
16.Thruster RPM #3
17.Thruster RPM #4
18.Thruster RPM #5
19.Thruster RPM #6
20. Thruster Temp #1
21.Thruster Temp #2
22.Thruster Temp #3
23.Thruster Temp #4
24.Thruster Temp #5
25.Thruster Temp #6
26.Water temp (From depth sensor, which is in contact w/ water)
