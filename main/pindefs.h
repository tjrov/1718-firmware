//=====LIGHTS====================================================================================================
//Set HIGH to turn on

//STATUS LIGHT (blue color)
#define STATUS_LED 13

//HEADLIGHTS (white color)
#define LED_CTRL A3

//=====MOTORS====================================================================================================
//To go forwards, set speed from 0<->255 by analogWrite (uses PWM) on MOTX_DIR1/
//0 is stopped, 255 is full forward
//Set MOTX_DIR2 to LOW by digitalWrite

//To reverse, set speed from 0<->255 by analogWrite on MOTX_DIR1
//Now, 255 is stopped and 0 is full reverse
//Set MOTX_DIR2 to HIGH by digitalWrite

//MOTOR 1
#define MOT1_DIR1 3

#define MOT1_DIR2 A1

#define MOT2_DIR1 5

//=====MISC====================================================================================================

//SPEAKER
//Set high with digitalWrite to power on Connor's noisemaker circuit and emit a (annoying, square-wavey) beep
//A specific beep pattern will activate the OBS release
#define SPK 10

//RS-485 TRANSMIT ENABLE
//Set high to transmit data from ROV onboard computer (this processor) to control station over tether
//Set low to receive data from control station (should be default state)
//This should be handled in the Modbus library. Just reference this pin there
#define TX_EN 2
